\section{What is the program about?}
It's about create intelligent organizations. The intelligence that we are going to study is collective intelligence. People working together in ways that seem intelligent.
Technology enable collective intelligence, like google and Wikipedia.
So the core question of the course is how can people and computers be connected so that -collectively- they act more intelligently than any person, group or computer has ever done before.
There are two ways to answer:
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Connecting people with each other in new ways,so they can act more intelligently as a group.
    \item Connecting people to computers that have more artificial intelligence.
  \end{itemize}
The Topics in this module will be:
  \begin{itemize}
    \item What is AI?
    \item How to use AI strategically
  \end{itemize}
The outcomes:
  \begin{itemize}
  	\item Know about AI in business.
  	\item Strategic and technical factors of AI in business.
  	\item Have an strategic plan
  	\item Have a broader knowledge of AI in business.
  	\item Won't be afraid of AI.
  \end{itemize}
